teris completely made with java 

this is probably one of my biggest projects but i could have definitely made it better because of how un-optimized the code is
i know right know its kinda empty so please give suggestions of what i should add (but no kick tables for cool rotation tricks) ðŸ˜Š

also please report any bugs if you bother to play this because i would love to make it as good as i can
